Simple python script for auto-incrementing the build number in pubspec.yaml each time you build your project

This one is pretty simple.  Place the python script in the root folder of your project and configure it as a pre-build task.  If you're using VS Code, you can use the two included json files as an example to modify your launch.json and tasks.json files.  If you don't already have a tasks.json file, you can drop mine straight into your .vscode folder.
