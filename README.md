# FlutterStep
This is a pretty simple script to solve a small inconveinece for which I could find no convenient solution on the internet.  It's based on this comment https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/41955#issuecomment-571321918 in the Flutter GitHub page.  Unfortunately, I'm no good at Perl.  When I couldn't get it to work, I decided to reuse the regex pattern and create a python script that is easily readable and modifiable.

## How to use
To use this, first make sure you have Python 3 installed.  Next, simply place the python script in the root folder of your project (i.e. the folder that holds your pubspec.yaml file) and configure it as a pre-build task.  If you're using VS Code, you can use the two included json files as an example to modify your *launch.json* and *tasks.json* files found in the .vscode folder.  If you don't already have a *tasks.json file*, you can drop mine straight into your project's .vscode folder, you may need to change `"python increment_build.py"` to something like `"python3 increment_build.py"` to accommodate your particular Python setup.
